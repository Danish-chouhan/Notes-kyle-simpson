---

> There are 3 types of emptiness 

## Undefined


> **Undefined** => Means the absence of value fo variable so the variable is decleared but still not assigned a value


## Undeclared

> **Undeclared** => means the varaiable is not decleared from **(let , const , var)** if we call a variable and it is undecleared then it will gives us **Refference Error Etc is not defined**

## uninitialized (As a (TDZ))

> **Uninitialized** => it is same as udecleared becouse when we call someting and it is not created then it will know as Uninittialized but it will gives a Error same as Undecleared Like **Refference Error  Etc is not defined**
